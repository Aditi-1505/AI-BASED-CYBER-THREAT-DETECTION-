# AI-BASED-CYBER-THREAT-DETECTION-
The primary objective of this project is to develop an intelligent, adaptive, and scalable AI-Based Cyber Threat Detection System that can accurately detect, analyze, and respond to evolving cyber threats in real-time. Unlike traditional signature-based or rule-based systems, this project utilizes advanced machine learning and deep learning algorithms to process and learn from large volumes of network traffic, user behavior, and system logs. The system is designed to detect a wide range of threats including malware, phishing attempts and zero-day vulnerabilities. 
By modeling the network environment as a dynamic structure—where data points like user activities and traffic patterns are represented as nodes and edges—the system applies various AI algorithms to enhance detection performance: 
•	Supervised Learning (Random Forest and Decision Trees): These models are trained on labeled datasets to recognize known attack patterns with high accuracy. 
•	Unsupervised Learning (K-Means): These models detect anomalies in system behavior, enabling the identification of previously unknown threats.
